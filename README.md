Hand Written Digits can be very easy for human eye to understand but they are not so easy to classify using traditional computer logic as they do not have any specific defination of how it has to be done. This project shows how using Convolution Neural Network this task of classifcation can be made easy and how well computer perform. 

The basic task is to categorize hand written digits into 10 different classes. I have used CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to perform the task. The final model used for notebook file has been used to obtained after some fine parameter tunning to the original model but the architecture of the model has been kept constant.
