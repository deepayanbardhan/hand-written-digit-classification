Hand Written Digits can be very easy for human eye to understand but they are not so easy to classify using traditional computer logic as they do not have any specific defination of how it has to be done. This project shows how using Convolution Neural Network this task of classifcation can be made easy and how well computer perform. 

The basic task is to categorize hand written digits into 10 different classes. I have used CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to perform the task. The result obtained are very good as it can be seen that it has achieved an efficiency over 98%. This shows how good Convolution Neural Networks are at observing patterns. You can also check my submission at kaggle with accuracy of 99.4% [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/submissions) which also takes into accont of rotation and linear translation.
